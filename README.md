# GenesisX

## Overview
After A monthe off from my battle with creating an engine that could play Tetris and succeseeding I started a new engine with the hopes to broaden my knowledge of new graphic API's and Graphic features. I think project did just that.

## Goals
My goals for this project was:
- Understanding and getting comfortable with the OpenGl API
- Studying the similarities and differences between OpenGL and DirectX
- Reinforce all the information I studied in that one month research about engines and do it agin with this one
- Implement Instance Rendering with OpenGL
- Venture forward and learn a new advanced graphics feature, which I chose was Deferred Rendering
- After implementing Deferred Rendering, Implement HDR and Bloom
- Build a FPS shooter with simple collision detection to demo how Deferred Rendering, HDR, and bloom work together
- The demo was a FPS that you shot glowing orbs of lights out from your gun which lit up the floor and the dark areas
- Implement "Scenes" which let me load in and unload assets for making new and different levels

## My Personal Engines:
### [**DayDreamEngine**](https://github.com/mray2014/DayDreamEngine)
- My latest engine I created to learn and study how to make an engine multi-threaded
- Combining all my years of experience with building engines to structure the engines architecure correctly
- Making the engine multiple platform so that adding new platforms like (DirectX/OpenGL/Vulkan) to the lower levels run smoothly

### [**Cosmic Engine**](https://github.com/mray2014/CosmicEngine)
- My third custom game engine I made that I believe is the best structured engine I've created so far
- Whats interesting about this project is that around this time I started learning about hardware and optimizations
- This engine put to test some architectures I thought of so structure the engine where most of the data was cache friendly optimized efficiently


### [**GenesisX**](https://github.com/mray2014/GenesisX)
- My second game engine I have created and it is honestly the one engine I most proud of
- After researching for weeks I finally implemented Deferred rendering into the engine, the hard work paid off
- Once I got that feature in I started steam rolling new graphical features in easily like HDR and Bloom because of all the knowledge I gained from Deferred Rendering


### [**Enginerino**](https://github.com/mray2014/Enginerino)
- My first game engine I ever created that I hold near and dear to my heart, even though it's not very good haha
- Implemented instance rendering for primitive models
- Created Tetris inside with my engine that plays smoothly
- This is when I found out engines were awesome and that I was about to down a very very VERY deep rabbit hole
